## 📌 Project Overview

Diffusion-based generative models such as Stable Diffusion produce high-quality images but lack fine-grained controllability over structure and semantic focus. **ControlNet** addresses this limitation by introducing external conditioning signals that guide the diffusion process while preserving the expressive power of pretrained models.

In this project, we explore ControlNet across **two complementary conditioning paradigms**:

1. **Anime Sketch Coloring (Structure-Based Control)**  
   Line-art sketches are used as a *hard structural constraint* to guide colorization while preserving spatial fidelity.

2. **Saliency-Guided Image Generation (Novel Task)**  
   Contextual saliency masks are used as a *soft spatial prior* to guide semantic attention in conjunction with text prompts.

The project includes dataset preparation, ControlNet training using Hugging Face Diffusers, extensive ablation studies, quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and an interactive demo.

## 🧠 Tasks Implemented

### Task 1: Anime Sketch Coloring
- **Control Signal:** Anime-style line-art sketches
- **Target:** Fully colored anime images
- **Control Type:** Hard structural control
- **Key Insight:** ControlNet enforces strict adherence to sketch boundaries while allowing color and texture diversity.

### Task 2: Saliency-Guided Generation
- **Control Signal:** Contextual saliency masks
- **Target:** Natural RGB images
- **Control Type:** Soft contextual control
- **Key Insight:** Saliency acts as an attention prior, guiding *where* content appears rather than enforcing exact geometry.
